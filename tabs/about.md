![pablo_boyu_pequenin](/assets/img/sample/pablo_guitar.jpg){: width="800"}

I'm a Ph.D. student and developer at the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/) from the Universitat
Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona. My fields of interest include signal processing and machine learning for audio, speech, and music applications.

Currently, I'm working on transfer learning applications for music classification with a focus on generalization. In the past, I've worked on the automatic assessment of audio quality. I spend a considerable amount of time developing algorithms for [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/).

In my free time, I'm an amateur guitarist and music producer, interested in progressive rock/metal and electronic music.
