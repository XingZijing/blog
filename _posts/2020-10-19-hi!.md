After almost 3 years of development and research work in the [Music Technology Group](https://www.upf.edu/), I’ve finally decided to enroll in the Ph.D. program!

Following the recent [announcement](https://www.upf.edu/web/mtg/home/-/asset_publisher/sWCQhjdDLWwE/content/id/237928479/maximized), I decided to make some minor changes to my website's `about` page. However, this resulted in a yak-shaving process that started by updating my GitHub user name (`pabloEntropia` → `palonso`) and ended up rebuilding my website from scratch.

My goal was to go for a more blog-ish layout that allowed me to keep track of the highlights of my Ph.D. So from now on, I’m planning to write more regularly about the outcomes of my research, the conferences I’m attending, [Essentia](https://essentia.upf.edu/), and maybe some offtopic music-related posts.
